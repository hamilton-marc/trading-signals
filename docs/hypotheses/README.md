# Hypotheses

This folder tracks strategy ideas using a lightweight scientific-method style.

## Intent
- Capture a clear observation.
- State a testable hypothesis and null hypothesis.
- Define what evidence would support or reject the idea.
- Keep experiments reproducible and comparable to baseline.

## Suggested Structure
Each hypothesis document should include:
1. Context / observation
2. Hypothesis
3. Null hypothesis
4. Proposed change (independent variable)
5. Experimental design
6. Metrics (dependent variables)
7. Acceptance criteria
8. Failure criteria
9. Next step
