# Product Vision - Trading Signals

## Introduction

Trading Signals is a personal, rules-based trading system built to eliminate emotional decision-making and replace discretionary trading with structured, automated execution. It exists to protect against inconsistency, regret, and avoidance by enforcing predefined entry, exit, and risk rules — allowing us to focus on long-term system refinement rather than short-term emotional reactions. This is a long-game engine designed to steadily build financial margin through discipline, not greed.

## Problem Statement
Discretionary trading leads to inconsistency, emotional decision-making, and avoidant behavior during volatility. Without predefined exit and risk rules, trades are negotiated in the moment, resulting in regret, drift, and loss of discipline.

We need a systematic, rules-based engine that removes mid-trade negotiation and replaces emotional reactions with predefined structure.

## Product Principles
- Eliminate emotional bias through predefined entry, exit, and risk rules.
- Reduce reliance on willpower by enforcing automation where possible.
- Favor discipline and repeatability over optimization and complexity.
- Build iteratively, refining the system rather than chasing signals.
- Protect downside first; upside is a byproduct of structure.

## Vision Outcome

Given a watchlist and defined rules, produce consistent, systematic trade decisions that:
- Define entries, exits, and risk before the trade is placed.
- Remove discretionary overrides.
- Encourage long-term compounding through disciplined execution.
- Allow focus to shift from individual trades to system refinement.

## Success Criteria
- Trades are entered and exited according to predefined rules without emotional negotiation.
- Manual overrides become rare and intentional rather than reactive.
- Drawdowns are managed according to plan rather than avoided.
- The system can operate with increasing levels of automation.
- Decision-making becomes calmer, more structured, and less emotionally charged over time.
