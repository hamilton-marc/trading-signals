# Product Vision - Trading Signals

## Introduction

Trading Signals is a personal, rules-based trading system built to eliminate emotional decision-making and replace discretionary trading with structured, automated execution. It exists to protect against inconsistency, regret, and avoidance by enforcing predefined entry, exit, and risk rules — allowing us to focus on long-term system refinement rather than short-term emotional reactions. This is a long-game engine designed to steadily build financial margin through discipline, not greed.

## Problem Statement
Manual chart review across many symbols and timeframes is slow and inconsistent. Discretionary decisions create drift from plan. We need a reliable, rules-driven workflow that transforms market data into consistent decisions.

## Product Principles
- Keep it simple, inspectable, and reproducible.
- Prefer transparent rules over black-box models.
- Build in small, runnable increments.
- Optimize for learning speed, decision clarity, and disciplined execution.

## Vision Outcome
Given a watchlist, produce repeatable daily decisions and shortlists with clear signal context across daily, weekly, and monthly views.

## Success Criteria
- The system can be run consistently with minimal manual intervention.
- Outputs are clear enough to trust, review, and improve over time.
- Execution behavior is increasingly disciplined and less emotional.
